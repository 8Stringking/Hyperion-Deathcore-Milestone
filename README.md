Welcome! to the Hyperion Uk Deathcore website! In this website we will shocase all of our previous releases, such as The Nibiru Cataclysm and showcase all our future upcoming material such as The Fall Of The City States, and more to come in the future. Also this will be the place where you the fans can see even more material first! such as playthrough videos of certain aspects of the band, and gain a key insight into how we make our records what they are, and even show you how we make and mix our songs including STL Tonehub Presets!

The overall aim of this project is to promote and showcase our material to our fans and fans of Heavy Deathcore all around the world! While giving the fans the opportunity to see content here first, before being released on social media, and also show that the South-West is still a great source of Deathcore bands.

# 1.User Experience

Welcome to the Hyperion website. This website is the hub for Hyperion content before anywhere else, and why weve chosen to do this is to give the fans a more in depth, and personal view of Hyperion rather than a standard Facebook or Instagram layout. We think this does reflect Hyperion in the best way and hope to grow our fanbase using this website. It also gives people the opportunity to book Hyperion for any event rather than using social media messages, as is the standard and sets out clear guidelines from the start.

# Target Audience

Weve tailored the design of this website for the fans of heavy music from Deathcore to Djent, and between the ages of 17 to 40 years old which is why the website is darker than the average website to cater to these tastes, and this has been done to capitilize on our eye catching artwork and to really make the content stand out, to draw in people that typically wouldnt like this style of music, as this is the purpose of all band social media and websites is to attract people far and wide and from all over the globe, as hyperion has done by having fans currently all the way from Indonesia and more.

# What the fans can expect

The Fans can expect a dark, simple, easy to navigate website packed full of all of our content in one place. No more scrolling through albums on facebook, or never ending scrolling on instagram, its all here and simple to navigate from page to page with a Navigation bar that we believe is stylish and is slightly bigger than your average to give the user the ease of accessing everything instantly.

They can also expect UN-RELEASED previews of our next EP 'Fall of the city states', bands dont typically do this, however we believe that the ability to listen to new songs not released anywhere else is a VITAL part of drawing new fans to us and the website and incredibly exciting for fans also.

# Web design

The web design of this page has been designed to give the user a simple and meaningful and functional experience, while being relevant towards the fan base hyperion is targeting (fans of heavy music/deathcore). This has been done by making the website quite dark, and having the content very light, causing no contrast issues for the user. The reason behind keeping it simple as stated above is usually fans would scroll through social media pages which arnt always as easy to navigate.

The home page has been used to drive the released album (the nibiru cataclysm) while giving more information on the band and having more of an overview of future material. The gallery page we've used as a timeline, hence the picture layout. The most recent being first and the older pictures last, letting fans see the most recent content first! The tours page weve put the nibiru cataclysm artwork in the background as this is the music mostly the fans would be hearing live. Inkeeping with a simple functional website, the tours page we wanted to simply contain links and use their logos that the fans know most in there countries. We know people are very picky about where they get their merch so laying it out in this fashion we know will be very useful for the user. The booking section does contain alot of sections to fill in, however being a musician for over 12 years i know that this is the information needed to reliably book a band. The nibiru cataclysm page again is kept simple using the eye catching artwork to draw in the user, and includes the full album stream from our youtube channel for instant access to that album. And lastly the Fall of the city states page simply includes new teasers and some of the new artwork that accompanies the new release. With the announcement on the homepage i felt no more was needed to explain this section and let the content stand out as much as possible again for a better user experience.

    <div>
    As you can see from the wireframes in the planning stage, the end result is pretty close, and the only reason this happened is due to the overall visual aspect of the page once I started coding the project. These changes were the track previews on the homepage, and the hyperion artwork, I didnt think it made sense having the track previews at the bottom below artwork and thought it was more user friendly to have the artwork almost act as a sub footer. Other than this i was really happy to be able to keep everything as is.

# 2.Website Features

- Animated Nav Bar, with hover feature/underline feature for page indication <img src="assets/website-walkthrough/nav-bar.jpg" width=35%>
- Youtube video links <img src="assets/website-walkthrough/youtube-links.jpg" width=35%>
- Audio players <img src="assets/website-walkthrough/audio-players.jpg" width=40%>
- Booking form <img src="assets/website-walkthrough/booking-form.jpg" width=30%>
- Clickable picture links which opens in new tab <img src="assets/website-walkthrough/clickable-links.jpg" width=30%>
- Social Media links which opens in new tab <img src="assets/website-walkthrough/socials.jpg" width=50%>

The Hyperion website unlike facebook and instagram and youtube (which are the primary source for fans interacting with a band and seeing their content) this website has been designed to have everyone in one place for the user.

The youtube links are done as such that they will play on the same webpage so that they can keep scrolling along that page as they listen to music (facebook/instagram/youtube currently cannot support this function) and the user can immerse themselves within all content on that page

The form section is alot more detailed than most, this is mainly due to in my 10 years playing in bands, and booking shows, this is the minimal information needed for a reliable booking, however we have made sure this is even more accurate by adding a clendar, and a clock for dates and times, and made sure it is viewable on all devices, and the proof it is functional is below.
<img src="assets/testing-images/form-data.jpg" width=45%>

Audio players are used throughout the site with the ability to scroll within a track, this has been done for releasing unreleased content, especially if you want to re-listen to a particular section within a song, and again so the user can continue to scroll within that page while listening to our tracks

The site contains two forms of clickable links. These are for the merch sites, using pictures for links as we know the target audience will recognise these famous logos and can choose where to get their merch from, this is an important part of driving the sales of merch. These days we know that people dont tend to spend too long viewing anything online at a time so by using these logos helps people make their choice faster and making their experience even better. The second is obviously the social media links, which weve used icons that will load up in seperate tabs so the user can stay where they are on the site.

# 3.Methods for creating the site (html5 css etc)

* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (was used for structuring and presenting content of the website)
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) (used for the styling of the content)
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) (used for all the font styling within the project, fonts used were Cinzel, and Cinzel decorative with serif used for a backup)

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) (used for the social media icons)
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) (this was used for the coding of the booking form into two columns, and the nav bar logo)
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) (used to debug and test the source code using HTML5 and to test site responsiveness)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) (used to create the repository and store the projects code after pushed from Git)
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) (used for the editing of code within the project for the site)
* [PlaceIt](https://placeit.net/) (was used for the mockup image for multiple devices)

# Manual Device Testing/Responsive Design Testing

I have carried out manual testing on the following devices to test responsiveness, all links and videos and music tracks and features all worked correctly. The devices were tested on the following:

* Galaxy S8
* iphone 5
* Google Pixel 2
* Ipad/Ipad Pro
* Tablets
* Laptops

## Manual Testing

Below is the methods I used to manually test my website

Test            | Outcome                          | Result
--------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------
Navigation Bar  | Does the nav bar navigate to each page?, and indicates with an underline what page you are on?, does it change color when hovering? | Pass
Animated Logo | Does the Hyperion logo animate upon page being loaded? | Pass
Youtube Video Links | Do they successfully play on every page? Do videos autoplay upon page loading? | Pass (does not autoplay upon loading)
Audio Players | Do they successfully play? Is auto play enabled upon loading? Do they work on every page? | Pass (does not autoplay upon loading)
Footer links | Do links successfully open in new tabs? | Pass
Booking Form | Does the form successfully submit data? Does the clock work? | Pass
Merch Picture Links | Do picture links take you to relavant site? are those sites in the correct country?Do they open in a new tab? | Pass
Responsive Test | Any issues with responsive testing? do all links,videos,animations,forms work on all devices? | Pass, No Issues Discovered
Background Contrast Issues | Is any content difficult to see due to background color or content color? | Pass (no issues)

I used [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) to check my website is responsive on all devices

## Expectations

From design concept i think the website delivers on the expectations for a fully functional, meaningful and user friendly website for fans of Hyperion, and is consistent across all devices.

# 5.Bugs

Currently on the website, there is only 1 bug that i have found. That is on the booking page the background image doesnt load on a mobile once pushed to gihub, although its a problem i am still actively trying to fix. The image has been put in via css as a background image, as it was the best way i could get all the elements on the page to display correctly. However this isnt detrimental to the page as the form is still clearly displayed and functional on the page.

# Historical Bugs and Issues Resolved

Initially the Nav bar was flagging as an error because the logo was placed in the middle of a UL as an anchor, this was resolved by using 2 seperate UL and placing the anchored image between the lists.

Another bug was the frameborder on the youtube video links causing an error in the html, this was fixed by using css to set the frameborder to none using the following code: iframe {
    border: none; }

Image sizing on the index page and the tours page was a big challenge, the pictures were displaying far too large on all devices, this was solved resizing the images to a much smaller pixel size so they could be used across all devices.

# 6.Future plans and goals for the website

The main plan for the future development of this website is to expand the page "Fall of the city states". Once the new EP is done, I want to upload all of the guitar presets used in recording the EP for the fans to download, including Rhythm, Lead, and Bass presets with samples. Also adding the individual stems for the tracks for people to practise mixing themselves. This is something not alot of bands do but fans wish they did, so i believe this will be a fantastic edition to the website, again increasing the feel good experience of the user.

# 7.Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub following these steps:

* Create Github Account
* Create a new repository
* Click on settings on the navigation bar under the repository title
* Select pages on the left menu bar
* Click on the master branch and save
* This has now created the link to your live website
* Live website link - https://8stringking.github.io/Hyperion-Deathcore-Milestone/
